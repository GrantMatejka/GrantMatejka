### Hi, I'm Grant Matejka ðŸŒ½

I'm currently working as an apprentice developer at iFixit, while pursuing a Master's at the beautiful Cal Poly SLO.

I've spent a few years as a professional web developer throughout my time in school, and my thesis is on the topic of WebAssembly, but I enjoy all kinds of programming. 

I love the puzzle, the process and the customer.
